		 	<h2>How Do We Predict Secondary Structure</h2>
			<div>
			PROFsec predicts secondary structure elements and solvent accessibility using evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments and a multi-level system (Rost &amp; Sander 1993). Three states of secondary structure are predicted: helix (H; includes alpha-, pi- and 3_10-helix), (beta-)strand (E = extended strand in beta-sheet conformation of at least two residues length) and loop (L). Secondary structure is predicted by a system of neural networks with an expected average accuracy of more than 72% (Rost &amp; Sander, Proteins, 1994; evaluation of accuracy).

		<h2>What is Predicted?</h2>
		<div>
			PROFsec predicts secondary structure elements, i.e. helix (H; includes alpha-, pi- and 3_10-helix), (beta-)strand (E = extended strand in beta-sheet conformation of at least two residues length) and loop (L). Furthermore, PROFacc predicts solvent accessibility of protein residues for 10 states of relative accessibility. These are grouped into two states: buried and exposed.		
		</div>

		<h2>What Can You Expect From Secondary Structure Prediction?</h2>
		<div>
		The expected levels of accuracy (PROFsec = 72¬±11% (three state per-residue accuracy) and PROFacc = 75¬±7% (two-state per-residue accuracy)) are valid for typical globular, water-soluble proteins when the multiple alignment contains many and diverse sequences. High values for the reliability indices indicate more accurate predictions. (Note: for alignments with little variation in the sequences, the reliability indices adopt misleadingly high values.)<br>
An expected accuracy of 70% does NOT imply that for your protein U 70% of all residues are correctly predicted. Instead, values published for prediction accuracy are averaged over hundreds of unique proteins. An expected accuracy of 70¬±10% (one standard deviation) implies that, on average, for two thirds of all proteins between 60 and 80% of the residues will be predicted correctly (expected accuracy of PHDsec). Thus, prediction accuracy can be higher than 80% or lower than 60% for your protein. Few methods supply well tested indices for the reliability of predictions. Such indices can help to reduce or increase your trust in a particular prediction.<br>
PROFsec (as well as other methods) focuses on predicting hydrogen bonds. Consequently, occasionally strongly predicted (high reliability index) helices are observed as strands and vice versa. PROFsec treats N- and C-terminal ends of proteins as solvent molecules. The size of the input window for predicting 1D structure is up to 17 residues. Thus, the first and the last 17 residues of your sequence will 'see solvent'. Especially for short fragments you did cut out from large proteins, this may result in false predictions.<br>

		<h2>How do we Predict Secobdary Structure</h2>
		<div>
Secondary structure and solvent accessibility is predicted by a system of neural networks with a window size of 17. Homology information is obtained by performing a BLAST search against UniprotKB/SwissProt and aligning the results with MaxHom. The resulting multiple sequence alignment is used as input for the network.</div>
